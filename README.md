# About this project

## UPDATE:

After completing my initial version of this web page, I took a step back and explored how I could improve my code.

For this revision, I had the following goals:
- Reduce redundancy (especially with divs)
- Address any code errors
- Prioritize semantic elements
- Add comments in the CCS file for clarity and organization
- Refresh the text content
- Personalize the design

I'm much happier with the current design. The revision experience was valuable as it allowed me to identify areas for improvement as well as the opportunity to infuse more creativity into the design.


## Original

For this project, I created an entire landing page from scratch based on [this design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) with [these colors and fonts](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png). I created a bird watching enthusiast community (Birders, Inc.) and replaced all of the dummy text. 

My goal for this project was to apply my knowledge of flexbox to position elements on the page. As I've learned, web pages are essentially made up of a series of boxes, and flexbox is a powerful tool for manipulating those containers. This project helped me understand the flex model, alignment, wrapping, flexibile sizing, and more.

I'm looking forward to expanding on this rudimentary design as I work on mastering flexbox.
