# About this project

For this project, I created an entire landing page from scratch based on [this design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) with [these colors and fonts](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png). I created a bird watching enthusiast community (Birders, Inc.) and replaced all of the dummy text. 

My goal for this project was to apply my knowledge of flexbox to position elements on the page. As I've learned, web pages are essentially made up of a series of boxes, and flexbox is a powerful tool for manipulating those containers. This project helped me understand the flex model, alignment, wrapping, flexibile sizing, and more.

I'm looking forward to expanding on this rudimentary design as I work on mastering flexbox.
